Atmosphere Publisher Subscriber WebSockets Example
==========================================

This is a web application showing simple integration between Atmosphere (https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) and Spring MVC 3.1
It uses a delegating WebSocketProtocol to intercept websockets channels.

Example has been tested against Firefox, Chrome and Safari.

There is no WebSockets support for IE (yet).
